# Sigma_base
Decentralized voting engine for creating and hosting elections. Anyone can create and hold elections, in an open, transparent and trustless manner. 

**How the system works**
## Create election
An election overseer or administrator can create an election easily by simply passing in the following: 

i. An election id <br/>
ii. Token name for vote tag <br/>
iii. Token symbol <br/>
iv. Election title <br/>
v. Date and time for start of election **in unix time** <br/>

When the needed data are provided, a new voting instance is created for that election. The details of the election are recorded and accessible. But no voting can hold just yet until the contesting candidates are added and the start election button clicked. The technical parts have been perfectly abstracted out for easy use of the newest web3 user.
